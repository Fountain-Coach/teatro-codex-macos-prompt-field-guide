## Overview

**Stage metaphor:** stage, actors, cues, light, entrance/exit.

**Prompts:**
- “Treat interface as a stage. Describe what enters, pauses, and exits.”
- “Explain how focus behaves like a spotlight.”
- “Reduce interface to essential gestures, not decoration.”
- “Describe psychological lighting: what reveals vs hides.”

## Key Ideas
- Describe interfaces as staged performances (entrances/exits, cues).
- Focus and light as spotlights; reduce to essential gestures.
- Prefer expressive minimalism over decorative complexity.

Examples: [Still Reflection](../examples/Still-Reflection.score.teatro), [Focus Shift](../examples/Focus-Shift.score.teatro).

## Try This
- Rewrite a cluttered UI as entrances/exits with a single spotlight of focus.
- Describe how search focus moves like a spotlight across elements.
- Remove decorative gestures; keep only those that carry meaning.
