# Examples

This folder contains small Teatro scores that demonstrate the language in context.

## “Still Reflection”
- File: `Still-Reflection.score.teatro`
- Focus: calm opening, gradual attention focus, reflective return
- Concepts illustrated:
  - Tempo/Light/Motion/Energy — see Part 08: Stage Dynamics (../parts/part-08.md)

### How to use
1. Open the score, read the header (palette/register/tempo/anchor).
2. Step through frames F1…F3 and map each gesture to the referenced chapters.
